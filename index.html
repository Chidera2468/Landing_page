    <h3 style="color:brown;">3 Key Features</h3>
    <p style="color:red;">Age and gender detection feature is a function that detects human faces in a photo and determines their age and gender.</p>
    <p style="color:red;">Luxand face recognition API uses algorithms to analyze and compare patterns in facial features to identify individuals.</p>
    <p style="color:red;">Face verification API works by comparing a given face to a stored reference photo to determine whether the two faces belong to the same person.</p>
    <h2 style="background-color:tomato;">About</h2>
    <p style="color:violet;">I have worked on many important projects throughout my ALX course. What’s really crucial for me when starting one is to get very clear on the goals 
      right at the start and then create a plan with milestones. I also like dealing with the most difficult parts of the projects earlier on that way in case there are any 
      significant issues, I’ll still have a nice amount of time to complete before the deadline. I also typically break down large tasks into smaller chunks, so that it is 
      easier to know where to start. Detailed planning is very important to ensure an important project goes smoothly. The mentality of doing hard things as we were thought right
      from the start gave me the inspiration to build on this project.</p>
